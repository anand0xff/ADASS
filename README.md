AMI Data Analysis Summary Site

Push-down stack of AMI data analysis 'milestones' or notable results to help AMI data analysis improve.

Create subdirectories - eg ./images, or ./oifits. ./kpfits for *small* files you link to in the table below

Create links to eg drivercode you used, etc etc.  Commit hash numbers identifying versions of implaneia/amical/candid/... might be helpful also.

Using [DoNothing](https://github.com/anand0xff/ADASS)'s (#1248a) extensive set of simulations and subsequent data analysis tools I discovered nothing new.  

    - sim oversample/pixel scale/distortion/jitters/placement error... 
    - noise sources, (sizes,...)
    - observables ' extraction ov=1023, FFT centroid, wrong pixel scale, spectrum not matched to simulation, various other advanced features.
    - candid step size 10mas central object disk 500mas
    - Accuracy of results: bus error during core dump
